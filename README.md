# MAZE-EXPLORER_TECHNEX2019
- a robot capable of solving a Maze and following a given trajectory

**Problem Statement**: To make a line following robot with the ability to solve a given maze and also detect over-head nodes placed along the path.

Our solution:
- We used PID to make the our custom built robot to follow the line.
- An altered version of the Left-Hand Rule was used to solve the maze in level 2. The tradition algorithm was ignored when a double node was detected as dictated by the PS.

Hardware Used:
- Self designed chasis with PolyCarbonate Sheet for light weight yet firm mechanical integrity of the structure.
- Arduino Mega
- BO motors
- Proximity sensor (to detect over head nodes)
- QTR 8RC, sensor array for line detection.
